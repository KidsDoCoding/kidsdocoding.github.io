						<div class="inner">
							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>Kids Do Coding! is aimed towards teaching 10 to 13 year old, beginning students the fundamental programming concepts that are necessary in today's computer-heavy world. We explore the various implementations of these concepts through the use of Python and Java, and we hope to build the foundation for a life long passion in computer science.</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<h2>Our Courses</h2>
							<p>We offer courses in both Python and Java, enabling students to choose which path they want to take. Regardless of the course taken, students can expect to receive invaluable learnings and a solid foundation in computer science.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<h3>Intro to Java</h3>
									<p>Our instructors will teach our curriculum (detailed below) as it applies to the Java language.</p>

							<h2>Our Curriculum</h2>
							<p>Our curriculum is a comprehensive, organized roadmap to master the intricacies of computer science. Our curriculum approaches Computer Science from a holistic level, and we cover concepts that are universal to all programming languages, which combine to make for a robust learning experience.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<h3>Console I/O</h3>
									<p>Python's built in functions like print() and input() can be used to create an interactive program.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Variables</h3>
									<p>Strings, Integers, Floats and Booleans can be used to organize code and unlock the true potential of programming. Operations with Numbers, Booleans and Strings can help us design truly powerful algorithms.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Conditionals</h3>
									<p>Comparative statements like If, Else If and Else allow us to create modular code that responds differently under different circumstances.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Iterables</h3>
									<p>Datatypes like Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries can be used to construct large datasets and easily navigate through it all.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Loops and Control Flow</h3>
									<p>From repeating code to traversing iterables, Loops allow us to do it all and are core to some of the most commonly used algorithms.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Functions/Methods</h3>
									<p>Structuring code and optimizing execution time and memory use, Functions mark the transition into more advanced programming concepts.</p>

							<h2>FAQ</h2>
							<h3>Should I attend the meetings alongside my child?</h3>
							<p>Parents are welcome to join in on our meetings! However, we will provide the necessary support to ensure that no student is left behind.</p>
							<h3>Am I required to attend every single meeting?</h3>
							<p>No, we cover one topic at a time, so you can treat our classes as standalone workshops. However, we highly reccomend that you do attend each lesson because it is important to learn the concepts sequentially, and you may not understand everything that goes on in one lecture if you don't know the content covered previously.</p>
